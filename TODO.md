TODO:

- AESTHETICS: (work on albumn and queue representations) when you're bored
- Saving audio vis data -- build general functionality to save and load, get and save audio data when new audio files found (wonder how big the json file will be)
- Search for albumn feature? (hm implementing this may be a bit difficult)
- Options for different audio vis features?
- Different tabs?
    - One with albumn select, currplaylist, another with 
    - Commands? regridding stuff?
